# Diving into Open Source & Reverse Engineering

> Sharing my journey of exploring open source projects and reverse engineering to understand how things really work.

I’ve always believed the best way to learn is by breaking things down from **first principles**. Over time, I’ll be sharing my learnings, insights, and small experiments on:

- Understanding how popular open source tools work under the hood
- Reverse engineering software to see how features are implemented
- Contributing back to the community with meaningful insights

### Why Open Source?

Open source is more than just code — it’s a learning ecosystem. By reading, experimenting, and even breaking things, you gain **deep understanding** that no tutorial can teach.

### Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is about **curiosity and problem solving**. It teaches you to think like the software itself and understand hidden mechanics.

Stay tuned as I explore projects, dissect tools, and share **tips, tricks, and experiments**.
